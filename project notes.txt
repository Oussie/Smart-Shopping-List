enter product link display name and price to user immediately ✅
make a new product object with that data ✅
make a class for products ✅
make an array of product objects ✅
display data to user in ui ✅
insertion sort algorithm to sort by price asc & dsc ✅
sql query to insert data into database ✅
make data persistent ✅

Issues ⚠️
If user adds new product to list then exports the data to the database, the entire list will be added to the database again which already contains the previous state of the list before the new product was added so it duplicates everything
SOLVED but solution possibly not scalable ✅
Price cannot always be found / price returned with other characters (just only test on pages that work)❌
IT DOESNT FUCKING WORK SOMETIMES FOR NO REASON !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!❌

Todo
check code makes sense to an examiner, comments are good, names of things make sense etc ✅
getters and setters? ❌
read spec make sure project meets requirements before doing paperwork eg all inputs are validated ✅
fully check code is done. ✅





one final check:
	go through guidance for each stage and (heriots booklets)
	proof read

submit NOW on FRIDAY so mr young can see what is missing (not how to improve)
ask on monday and correct it if needed.

I think usability testing (persona testing) not enough
page count worrying me also
